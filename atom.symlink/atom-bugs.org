ATOM BUGS TO POSSIBLY REPORT

when a new version of a package becomes available, and you haven't yet updated,
  but say you're searching in the setting-menu package search. it will display
  with 'install' as if it weren't installed at all. 'update' would be better

- package update: "version x is installed" but update button still shown.
  I took a screencap

- lots of weird bugs with the audio beep

the save dialog seems to be defaulting to .ATOM files a lot. maybe just when
  saving from this atomfiles repo.

Plugin downloads seem awfully big??

-travis-ci-status taking absurdly long to load. vim-mode also slow

-autoflow selection doesn't seem to work on my config-scribbles
-my package: the red showing up when typing in package search box in settings. find
  some way to make the red specific to only an editing pane

  -vim mode y then p doesnt seem to always work

-visual-bell isn't displaying for whatever reason

-probably an os-level bug with alt-x beeping
